"20,""We bought tickets for both parks, the shuttle brought us from universal Cabana bay hotel.  First trip over we walked to get voodoo donuts. The security guard would not let us in because our daughter had a shirt that had a tiny bad word on it you could hardly read unless you were focused on looking at her breasts. They would not let us turn it inside out, made us walk back to the hotel to change. When we went back into the park, music was playing with cuss words...so much for free speech. Shopped at a few stores, more profanity on shirts....i guess it’s ok to buy the stuff inside the park but don’t wear any into the park...makes total sense.  We arrived early to the park the second day and started riding the rides. Lines were not long and it was easy to get onto rides. The bathrooms were filthy and smelled. Workers were not friendly. Very rude and I never heard anyone say please or thank you. We were told thousands of times to pull our masks over our nose although my mask was stretched out from the rides it would not stay in place. Social distancing was good. Rides were fun. Lots of stuff was closed. Food that was open was gross and way overpriced. Most workers seemed to not speak much English. Not worth $700 for 4 people."""	
"40,""My family of 4 (parents with 15 yo and 9 yo) visited Universal Orlando (Universal Studios?)the week of Dec. 27, 2020. When we heard about the capacity limits, we were a bit concerned as they were NOT taking reservations to ensure entry like the other parks. However, we made a point to get up early each day and we got into the parks each time. Once in, they did a nice job of making people wear masks, giving hand sanitizer before each ride and marking 6 ft increments for standing in lines. Even though there were capacity limits (exactly what, they won't say) we thought the park seemed very busy and lines were long. We waited an average of 50 minutes for most rides, but posted times were usually twice what we actually waited. We did not pay for express lines but could see where it would be a smart purchase.... Food lines were also very long around lunch time so we ended up eating in City Walk. My family enjoyed all the rides like the Hulk, Spiderman, The Mummy, Rip Ride Rocket, Escape from Gringotts and more. The whole Harry Potter area was very busy, but that's what's popular! One thing I wish I had known: absolutely NO items can be in your pockets for the Rip Ride Rocket. This whole ride cue was crazy each of the 3 times we rode. The line was confusing, people shouting about lockers, some warning people about the No items in your pockets, people turning back.... I was really ticked off until we figured it out. Anyway, considered yourself warned!! Otherwise, fun day!"""	
"50,""Our experience was amazing through and through. We stayed at Royal Pacific Resort and either took the walking trail or water taxi to get in/out of the park. They did a great job at making sure masks were on and handing out sanitizer before every ride. I specifically want to give a shout-out to Brenda who was working at the Pteradon Flyers ride. She went above and beyond to make sure both me and my husband got to switch and ride with our daughter while making sure we didn’t wait too long. Also, Pat in Harry Potter world (Diagon Alley) was fun! She did a special little ceremony with an invisible trophy after challenging me to name all the gargoyles on a certain triangular shaped building. Thanks for an amazing time!"""	
"20,""For anyone thinking that the park is going to be less crowded or you will be able to go on more rides, this is not the case. The park is extremely crowded in certain areas and almost all wait times were over an hour and some close to 2 hours. We have been here before and we actually were even close to being able to ride on as many rides as we did last time we were there. We have a child with a disability and the disability pass did not help at all."""	
"30,""For a family of 4 at over $550 admission, you can find many others activities to do that you’ll enjoy more. We got there early at 8am and parked in premium (which is worth the $5 extra). All of the checkin part was easy. They take your temperature and have social distancing signs everywhere (although most people don’t pay attention.) The girls really enjoyed the Harry Potter area and we spent more money in there for lunch and accessories. The Mummy and roller coaster were closed. The fast and furious was a 2 hour wait. Some other attractions were shorter waits, but going on 4 or 5 attractions all before noon left nothing left to do the rest of the day with so many events closed. I would recommend a lower admission ticket price during this time since so many things closed ."""	
"30,""I had a lot of fun I liked how they were taking precautions it’s masks the whole time and from what I could see the lines were very long but me and my family had fast passes the only thing I didn’t enjoy was the shortened hours"""	
"20,""Returned to Orlando Christmas time. Tried to do theme parks, hoping to do more than two attractions in five days of line waiting and breakdowns this time (my experience last year). Sad, but thought may have a chance do due to restrictions.  Parks were more enjoyable this time, but the city vibe... still desperate. Tired of the prejudice. Used to be if not Latino, really felt it. Now, if not black really feel the rude avoidance (and the Latino/Cubano that are trying to side as """"black"""" more now because is superior group for better drama affect, but then just have more egocentric rude people wanting you out of the way).  Got tired of the """"congenial, together, progressive acting"""" black family, that won't even let you pass by them, or acknowledge your Christmas spirit there waiting too. Is all about them (but enjoying the charity of Christmas time!) and comes off contradictory and morally progressive acting, which is egocentric and discrimination is still, ah... discrimination. Hypocritical). Got tired of that treatment in """"the happiest place on earth"""". And we're in a pandemic, but do keep disregarding others.  I did ok asking for directions and locals would say """"No English..."""" so I asked in Spanish. Seemed got a bit better acknowledgement of being a human being there then. Or got them embarrassed.  (Confirms the current and to continue """"moral progressive discrimination"""" which is going on. Merry Christmas). And listen to the African Uber drivers criticize the blacks here! Why is that?  Or, standing outside the airport leaving that flat hot egocentric place of hypocrisy, and a gentleman standing next to me kept muttering something over and over. Then staring at me made out the continual """"when ya gonna pay me back!"""" What? Oh, I guess when you stop benefiting from medicine, advances in medical care, eyeglasses, and when you stop using and give back your iPhone and laptops. or money benefits I'm paying for in taxes (on what job I can get because not female or of color so my degrees hard worked for don't matter). So... when can I expect to see those turned in? Because to not would be counter to what you are grieving about (people that invented those didn't have as much Melanin content in their skin, so I guess must be canceled out).  And where's the petition to close down the """"White"""" Disney parks? Ok, no problem. When then? Because otherwise that would be hypocrisy in that cause"	
"50,""We visited the theme park on a Friday, and really enjoyed it. The wait times were minimal. We did arrive to the park before 9, but the gates opened at 9. We rode most of the rides before lunch. We also enjoyed the new crape place as well as butter bear. We ate lunch at Mels Dinner and the price was good for all the food we got. You did have to use hand sanitizer before every ride, but I completely understand that they are taking precautions to help keep the park open and safe. Definetly reccommend going in January."""	" don't want that. Just trying to help. And, no worry. I won't be back. I'll save my money to move somewhere I'm welcome. Sure not this country. Got what you wanted! Enjoy!"""
"40,""My first time here but we were not visiting the parks - we had reservations at the toothsome chocolate restaurant. I didn’t know city walk had the same entrance and parking as the parks. Parking was $26. The Parks were full but there were a lot of folks around the city walk shops and restaurants."""	
"30,""This universal park is in need of some updating and some more attractions. Most of the rides on this side are virtual reality. Jimmy Fallon ride is fun and MIB is cute. The Wizarding World area and the Hogwarts express are the best parts of this park for sure."""	
"30,""Orwellian signs everywhere to comply or be removed, staff constantly nagging about masks. If I had taken it down for a second to get a breath of fresh air in the Florida heat, I was immediately yelled at. Staff was also incredibly rude. My boyfriend and I were the only ones in a cart on of the rides so we pulled our masks down, the music of the ride stopped and we were called over the loud speaker by employees to keep our masks on, despite the fact that there was no one else riding with us. Ordering food on the app was not very convenient considering there were a lot of people on the server. Not sure why it's not safe to place an order with an actual person? When getting off the Hulk, the employees announced the ride was closed because the area was at capacity when the line was actually much shorter and less crowded than when my group was in line. Volcano Bay this past summer is much more lax with masks considering it is a water park, which begs the question: why it's safe to not wear masks there and not in the other theme parks? Drop the act. Why they're so strict for a virus that has 99.9% survival rate is beyond me. Will not go back again until things go back to normal, if ever."""	
"50,""Had a really great time. I've really missed this place. Safety protocols were in place for the party-pooping Karens and Kevins out there who are still afraid of breathing fresh air but thank God they were not overbearing, just kind reminders without ruining the experience even though I am more than tired of the hysteria. Surprisingly it was crowded more than usual during this time last year. I see it as a good thing as it means people are ready to get on with their lives and get back to having some real fun. You have got to get in early due to capacity limits. Thank you, Universal for showing us a good time and not being a bunch of overbearing nannies. Don't listen to the bitter haters claiming Disney World is better and attacking you on """"safety"""" measures. Disney World is beyond terrible. The staff here was great!"""	
"50,""The house band at the HR is awesome! Abby Road sounded great. Social distancing was not a problem. Best NYE in years!"""	
"50,""This was our 3rd visit to Universal in 5 years. We have 3 teenagers and 2 toddlers, and it is one of the few places we can go that all of us enjoy - including the adults! We stay onsite for early admission and to walk to the park. We also do Express Pass - well worth it. We also spent 1 day at Magic Kingdom this trip so had a direct comparison and Universal is better for us. More beautiful grounds, they kept more open during COVID (they had characters and parade, Disney had none). Harry Potter world is amazing - just spectacular detail. Hagrid ride is the best coaster ever."""	
"50,""We absolutely love Universal Orlando and come all the way from Washington state to visit. We always stay at a Loews property to get early admission and express passes - that is really the best way to go! We have stayed at Royal Pacific, the Hard Rock, and now Portofino Bay. No walk from a hotel to the parks is more than 20 mins tops - so we usually walk but have also used the boats. Boats are slower to board but you've already gotten through security and temperature checks making it sometimes a better option. The parks (Universal and Islands) are packed. I asked someone about capacity and they said it is reduced but with restaurants closed and social distancing on the rides more people are out in the main walking areas. Well, that was for sure - some areas were very crowded! But anyone saying people weren't wearing masks was somewhere else - or maybe talking about the rest areas they have where you don't have to be masked but needed to be 6 ft apart? We were there for 5 days and never saw anyone not wearing a mask. In fact, when someone (inevitably) had it below his/her nose, they were told to fix that. Some people didn't want to observe the stickers on the ground (at the rides) but usually a good long stare at them and then at the sticker would make them be more mindful. If you don't have an express pass - not sure you want to be there when the park is full. Most rides had lines of 2-3 HOURS, but with express pass you pretty much walk right up. If you are at Islands and want to ride Hagrids - you have to get a virtual pass. If you try to go at 7am and just get in line you could wait 60-90 mins. But with a virtual pass we only waited 30 mins even on the busiest days. We rode the ride 4 times and it was A BLAST. Our girls are 12 and 13 and they love Universal. Yes, it is crowded, yes it is expensive, but the HP parts of the parks are magical. This was our 4th trip and it was a blast."""	
"50,""If you want to walk around all day and not ride any rides, this is the place to go!! Such a waste of money and time!! We bought our tickets in SEPTEMBER for a trip in December. On the first day, we get there around 7:50am, people are pushing and running to get to the gate. Cutting in lines (apparently they know whats about to go down). We get in the park, it was nice - stood in line for about two hours for Rip Ride Rocket (we were the first maybe 20 people in line for the ride, the ride didnt start until 9:45), Within 30 minutes of standing there the line was already at capacity and was a 3 hour wait. WTF!? We walk around, all while being on the useless Universal App, trying to find a line that didnt have 400 minute wait time. We tried the virtual queues, but those are worthless. We did manage to get on The Mummy ride around 1pm (our second ride of the day). The park has already reached capacity at 9:10am - that should have been a clue for us. We rode our 3rd ride due to the nicest employee, Alexandra. We talked with her for a bit and voiced concerns about the park (why are there so many people here, is universal over selling tickets -, she asked if there was anything she could do and we said """"could you get us on a ride, any ride?! She said OF COURSE! So we headed to Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts - THANK THE BABY JESUS Alexandra was there or we would have never got on the ride - it was at capacity all day. We were at the park for 14 hours and rode 9 rides. We purchased 2 Day Park to Park tickets and was unable to go to the second park because of capacity. We couldn't even make it to the park the second day because it had already reached capacity at 8:03am. It was a f**^ing joke and not the Universal Studios I remember from the early 2000's. One last note - we were going to purchase the Unlimited Fast Pass but at $320 a ticket ON TOP OF the ticket we already purchased to get in the park, was a rip off!! PRICE GAUGING !!!!!!!!!! WE PAID AROUND $1800 TO GET INTO THE PARK FOR TWO DAYS AND UNIVERSAL WANTED ANOTHER $1900 FOR FAST PASSES FOR ONE DAY - ABSOLUTELY ASININE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This park is operating over capacity!!!! Covid or not!!"""	
"10,""Really disappointed. They only have six rides per park and all rides are 2+ hour waits. The Harry Potter wands and costumes are a ripoff. Universal charges $150.00+ USD and you can get the exact same ones from Amazon for $29.99. The food is insanely priced as well. The park is also so full you can’t walk 6ft apart. They also charge for parking Separately. I would never visit Universal studios again total scam"""	
"30,""I personally haven’t been to this park in a while, I recall back to the future and ET as the primary rides that used to be there, they’ve now put in CGI movie rides that replace the better rides, (in my opinion) And they all or just motion rides tilting you from side to side and front and back with a little bit of spritzer of water. Nothing to me really exciting except for the rip rockin roller coaster in which I had ridden twice. The crowds were rather full, as for the Covid policies that were required, many people wearing masks, however not really sticking to the 6 foot rule. Very crowded. Guest services were good, accommodating."""	
"40,""We arrived in Orlando collected our bags and headed to the universal desk to sign in for shuttle service the the Cabana Bay Resort. We waited 20 mins before the shuttle arrived then rode around in the worn out van for 93 minutes before arriving at our hotel. Complete inefficiency on the part of the driver and whomever schedules the stops. Bad first impression. That sums up issue #1.  We purchased everything we were offered as far as Express Passes and Early entry to the parks. On day 2 of our trip we planned to enter the park at 7. Once we arrived it was obviously PACKED. Super LONG lines. We had no idea where to go and had a hard time finding an attendant to assist us. Once we did, we were told no one is getting in even with an early admission pass. """"back of the line please Sir"""". So we waited. Day 3 same thing. I approached another attendant and explained we paid for early entry and were in line with people who had not yet purchased tickets. """"Back of the line Sir"""". Later that night I called Universal Customer Service and explained our issue. The lady told me that the park had totally screwed up. She advised that on the next day we don't take no for an answer as she could see what we had purchased and it was everything that could be purchased. Day 4 and 5 we had to shove and push our way to the front and demand the person at the gate investigate our tickets closer. After that we were in. Took a few days to learn the ropes but once inside the park we found the Express Pass worked well and we are glad we purchased them. Early entry is another story."""	
"30,""We went last week in December and as usual, very busy. We heard they were going to be like 40% capacity, NO WAY! They were even more busy than this time last year. I was shocked. After going to Disney and seeing how safe they were, Universal was completely the opposite. No social distancing. They didn't care if people were walking around without a mask. We waited 1 hour and 45 min in the guest services line. We waited 5 at Disney. Universal needs to get their self together. I don't think we will be back for awhile after what we experienced this time, and we go every year. Shame on you, Universal!"""	
"20,""This park was over crowded and you can’t even get on rides! You have to be at the park before 7:30 in order to get in. One day we were not able to get into the park. Not sure what this place is doing but it’s a COVID super spreader!! SeaWorld is a better park and not crowded at all. We were not disappointed. Disney was being too as they did reservations and we were got in the park. Not crowded and had the most fun!!"""	
"50,""I was vert impressed with the precautionary measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Being a pass holder ive been to the park countless times. They had tapes on the floor indicating where each party should stand"	
"30,""Not consistent with covid safety on days with large crowds hit or miss temp checks sanitizer. Not able to maintain 6feet walking through park or existing rides on peak or capacity days due to crowds they need to rethink their numbers for capacity to allow for this. On days with light crowd covid safety maintained constant. Passholder days made for higher capacity even with unlimited express ride time waits were as 2hrs or more. Days without PASSHOLDER or high capacity ride wait were less than 30min w express pass. I believe if they had opened Volcano Bay it might have helped w crowds bc some hotel guest might have opted to go there instead of fight crowds w PASSHOLDER at other parks. Was treated like second class citizen using Universal dining plan waite staff acted like I was an inconvenience can't use dining plan.with mobile app most restaurants wanted you to use that. Also dining plan hard needs a virtual way for patron to check what is left on cards keeping up with multiple recipiets for multiple cards is difficult. Needs a transportation system from back of park to front like Disneyland train so if your at back of park and exhausted or kids exhausted can ride to front of park to exit. Leaky cauldron,three broomstick, margaritville gave best service even with Universal dining was treated w respect and kindness. Rides w virtual lines impossible to get passes for never got one for Jimmy fallon or revengeof mummy. Only got one pass in 14days Hagrid motorbike. Only able to ride Hagrid motorbike with hotel early admission."""	" at least 6 feet away from the other party...people were spaced out and in some cases there were plexiglass separating people. To protect people each person was given sanitizer right right before getting on the ride. they had sanitizer stations all over the park ... they had a lot of people holding signs reminding you to wear your mask ... you cannot walk around while eating or drinking...you can only be stationary when actually eating or drinking... your mask must cover your nose or your mouth... I observe them reminding people from time to time. If you haven’t seen the Bourne Stuntacular, you should go see it ...my only problem with that, was the social distancing with a little off... they were social distancing along the rows ...people sitting next to you with 3 seats between parties... but there were other people sitting right in front of you and right behind you which doesn’t make sense... in all it was a great experience and I’m glad I took my family to there."""
"30,""Had a 1 day visit during Christmas week. Be PREPARED for multiple checkpoints and poor directions/signage (which is bad both outside the park and inside as well). Few signs to help find your way around and what few they do have the font is small and hard to spot. After allowing multiple people to PAY for parking these same people were TURNED AWAY at the park entrance if they didn’t have a DATED ticket for the day they visited the park because the parks were at capacity. We were fortunate enough to have a dated ticket and allowed admission, but I felt badly for those people who had already parked and made the long trek to the gate only to be turned away. Was some of it OVERSIGHT and POOR PLANNING by the visitors...YES, but Universal personnel could have done a much better job of screening and informing at the entrance to parking. I don’t know if these people were given a refund."""	
"50,""Bourne show is the most fascinating to me. I enjoyed the amazing work they did for the show. The stunt and special effects blow my mind."""	
"40,""This place so awesome. I recommend getting the flash pass b/c the lines and wait time will be forever. We were able to ride several rides w/ the pass for Both parks and it was great but get the App for all rides wait times. All people wore mask and were 6 feet apart when in line so we felt safe during pandemic. We took advantage of the after hours Harry Potter Tour and it was well worth it to go on a Private tour of the park. The place is clean and people respected the Mask policy."""	
"20,""Staff is very rude and not very """"disney like"""". One employee pushed my finger away as I was trying to show her something and another was telling people sarcastically to """"use your ears"""" when she was giving instructions. There are only 2 good rides and the tickets are sold as a package, come to find out we can only get into one park (universal or adventure island). Wouldn't recommend this park."""	
"20,""Super over crowded! I was there on 12/29/20 along with thousands of other people. To improve my and your experience, Universal Studios should more strictly limit ticket availability when we buy our tickets online rather than limiting attraction capacity once you are in the park. I had one day to go to Universal so had I known it would be nearly impossible for me to get into any of the major attractions with less than a 2.5-3.0 hour wait in line, I wouldn't have bought a ticket. I was so frustrated by noon, that I found the Guest Services office and waited in line for 1.5 hours to request a refund, which Universal did grant, and allowed me to stay in the park the rest of the day. Universal Studios has a lot to offer, but it needs to manage its capacity better and enforce social distancing, like Disney does so well, to reduce COVID-19 transmission."""	
"40,""Beautiful and clean park, it's just very very busy when you're there the last week of the year. Long lines for rides, foods and restrooms. Wouldn't come back at this time of year again."""	
"40,""The only way to do Universal is with the Express Pass! It hit capacity every day of our trip by 9am. Some rides, we waited 10 minutes, some we waited 30 minutes. THE MOST difficult ride to get on is Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure. This ride doesn’t take Express Pass. We tried the Virtual Line and were never successful until after 7pm! One day, guest services helped put us on the ride because it was our last day. We made dinner reservations 24 hours in advance. We felt that we did not need a dining plan. We did the breakfast at The Leaky Cauldron and food was decent. There is minimal service there due to Covid. During our trip, we also went to Epcot one day (we had never been), and Universal has managed the whole Covid thing WAY better than Disney. Lines were long there 90-120 minutes waiting time for rides and NO fast passes!"""	
"10,""Don’t go right now. We visited 12/31/20 with the hopes they were following COVID protocols similar to Disney. They were not! Wall-to-wall people! No ability to social distance at all. The ride ques were ok, but the park was more crowded than I’ve ever experienced it before. There were rides we were never even able to get on because some of the lines were up to 3 hours or closed because they “reached capacity.” If I could somehow get my money back I totally would. What a waste! We should’ve spent an extra day at Disney instead. Disney is doing things well in the parks!"""	
"50,""Spent a few days here with my 15 year old twins. The only complaint they had was sore feet from going all day long. Theres no shortage of things to do here. Tip: Stay on the resort property and get express passes. Makes life a lot easier. Enjoy"""	
"10,""My family interrupted our Disney vacation to spend the day at Universal Islands of Adventure. First of all, the ticket prices were exorbitant and after spending the day there, totally not worth the price of admission. Arriving around 8:20, parks were already “at capacity”. Upon admission to the park I’m not sure what their capacity is because it seemed much more than 30-35%. People were shoulder to shoulder. Little to no social distancing. People not wearing masks properly. Many people in lines and walking around with masks down on chins, eating and drinking food while in lines and walking around. Staff not doing anything to correct violations. All virtual queues were filled throughout the day. The only positive was that queues moved faster than the wait times listed but still waited a minimum of one hour or more for each ride. My family and I felt so incredibly uncomfortable the entire day and didn’t leave because we spent over $500 for one day tickets. I am so regretful that I didn’t read reviews prior to going and pray my family doesn’t get COVID after this experience. The two prior days we spent at Disney and it was a polar opposite experience. Disney clearly values its patrons’ health, safety and overall customer experience so much more than Universal. Bottom line, I don’t recommend going to Universal if you value your health and wallet!!!!! I would give zero stars if I could. Universal executives- maybe you should spend a day at Disney to get a lesson how things should be run!!!!! You should be ashamed of stealing people’s money for the experience you’re delivering."""	
"10,""In the hopes that Universal was heeding advice from the CDC much like Disney properties were, we visited Universal after Christmas. The parks were both filled fuller than I’ve ever seen them filled and social distancing was a joke. It just wasn’t even possible to socially distance in the thoroughfares. The “virtual line” system was a failure as spots were released four times a day and at those times each day, the app platform was frequently overloaded and non functional. The order ahead option for food was also a joke- great that you get to order ahead on an app- but it fails when universal execs don’t staff food centers to handle those app orders- wait times were crazy and staff were obviously overworked. The whole experience was awful- but hey- at least universal is making bank during covid"""	
"30,""The good. Almost all rides and shows were open and operational. The food at the table service restaurants in the parks is EXCELLENT. Holiday hours kept the parks open till 10pm. They did extend one of our tickets to a later date due to park capacity.  The bad. Universal Studios does not have an advanced reservation system for park entry. This is odd considering the fact that many smaller amusement parks do have this. Basically, this results in a mad rush in the morning in attempt to gain entry to the park before it reaches capacity. We went for four days. The park opened at 8AM. One day we arrived at 10AM and were denied entry due to park capacity. This left us with nothing to do on one day of our vacation. Although they did give us a replacement ticket for a later date, the process for obtaining it was cumbersome. First, I attempted to call guest services where I waited on hold for 40 minutes with no one answering, then we waited in line at guest services for an hour before a representative saw us and give us the ticket. When we were given the replacement ticket, no one could print out a confirmation of this for my records. We were told it’s “stored in their system” and that I could call their 1-800 number to get a confirmation emailed to me. When I called the number, the first agent gave me inaccurate info and I had to call back. After being on the phone for half an hour on the second call, I was finally able to get someone to generate an email and send it to me. Regarding covid… We aren’t particularly scared of covid, but if you are, you should know that the park was packed. Lines for rides were regularly 2+ hr wait. Although they did have markers in the lines for social distancing, it was rare to be six feet away from other guests. In fact, we were often shoulder to shoulder with other guests whether we wanted to be or not. The line for food was an hour or more at the majority of dining locations during much of the day. Probably my biggest concern was around the behavior of some staff members. They require you to use hand sanitizer at every ride. At one ride, a staff member accused me of not taking it, then proceeded to get in an argument with me and call me a liar in front of an entire line of guests. Overall, I would probably try a different park chain next time."""	
"10,""It’s a racket. Pay your parking pass and then be told they are at capacity and don’t refund your money. They sure are doing more than capacity. Very disappointed in the way they are doing business. Ridiculous!,!!"""	
"50,""This pretty lady is the best ever STAFF from guest services. Very helpful and very kind. She would do everything to help you when facing an issue or problem. Her performance is ABOVE & BEYOND anyone I met here. She helped me resolve an issue no one else could. Thanks Kristen.. All the best"""	
"10,""My family and I spent 8 long, miserable hours there yesterday, and I see it as a public service responsibility to share our experience. This park over books, which results in multiple rides closing their lines at a time due to having reached ‘capacity.’ As a result they suggest people go on their app and monitor wait times, which do nothing to let you know when the lines will re-open. When we asked for a solution to that problem, they suggested we reserve a time to return through the ‘virtual’ feature on their app. When we tried to do that the app told us that all of the virtual spots gad been filled. When we asked how to fix that issue, they told us that virtual spots open every 2 hours, on the exact hour. So at 2 pm when the app started to take our reservation, it locked us out midway (as we were literally typing our name), saying the spot had just been taken by someone else. When we returned to the minion line to explain what happened and that we have been trying to get on this line for over 2 hours, being recognized by the ticket woman, they still said no, the supervisor (blond hair in a ponytail, blue eyes) said he would not make an exception. It did not help that we had arrived at 8:30 in the morning to purchase express passes, which by then had sold out. Adding to this, the pizza was raw, there was little social distancing monitored except in some lines, and they gave you a pea-sized squirt of sanitizer before every ride (good luck tracking down a full dispenser after). If you don’t have a problem walking a few miles glued to your phone, hoping you will get a virtual reservation after all of the best rides (Harry Potter escape from Gringotts, Minions, Mummy, and Jimmy Fallon Race through NY) close their lines, and if once you get on a line you don’t mind waiting over 2 hours, then Universal Studios may be a good match for you. For us however, the bottom line is that we rode 2 rides in 8 hours. This was a surprise Christmas gift for our kids, we had posted our anticipation all over Facebook on Christmas morning, and we left in tears with my husband having to carry our 9 year old on his shoulders she was exhausted as we all were by walking mikes to catch a ride without avail. By the end of it, Andrea at Guest Services acted as though she were doing me a favor by giving us a refund. I told her We deserved the refund *and* free express passes for this heap of nonsenses. This was the centerpiece of a $6K vacation for us, ending in apologies to our kids and more tears. Don’t go here. It’s pouring money in a drain and risking your and your family’s health and safety due to rampant COVID noncompliance."""	
"50,""We came the week before Christmas and had the best time! We felt very safe with tons of sanitizer stations, temperature checks, employees there specifically to monitor mask compliance, and employees specifically there to squirt hand sanitizer onto your hands before entering a ride. There were 6 foot markers all over the park. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we had Express Pass, which was AWESOME! We never waited more than 10 minutes for any ride except for Hagrid's. Diagon Alley is really quiet if you go the last 2 hours before closing. We appreciated that Universal still had so much to offer while Disney has cancelled so much of their entertainment (which is why we cancelled out Disney trip). The Christmas decorations were gorgeous and I just can't say enough how much we enjoyed our time at the parks. We were sad that the Grinchmas show was cancelled as well as the castle light show, but understand how crowded those areas are. We loved the Cinematic Spectacular though!"""	
"30,""Disclaimer: I am a die hard Disney fan. However, no land in Disney holds a candle to Diagon Alley. The detailing, immersive nature and even the entrance being designed to take you “through a wall” are second to none. So- here we are.  This rating is purely based on my experience during the pandemic. Here are the PROS, the CONS and TIPS and what to expect.  PROS: As mentioned- Diagon Alley is unparalleled. It’s just fantastic. Buy an interactive wand, it’s worth it. King’s Cross Station- again, platform 9 3/4 is just great. Get a park to park ticket if you and to take the train, and take it from both directions. Worth it.  CONS: As much as I love Diagon Alley (and I do, I REALLY do), the rest of the park is, well... MEH. Don’t get me wrong, there are a few must do’s- Bourne Show is incredible, and Minion Mayhem is great- but nothing really holds a candle to HP land... and EVERYONE knows it. If there are a hundred people in the park, 99 of them will be in Diagon Alley. Prepare for this. If it is a crowded day, DA will be absolutely packed and if you can’t see the details, you honestly miss it. Don’t just flock to Gringott’s (though this queue and ride is great). This brings me to...  WHAT TO EXPECT: COVID precautions in some areas are apparent and in other areas not. First, the positive- ride line spacing is great. Very spaced and people generally followed. Mask wearing is enforced. Sanitizer is plentiful and ride cars are spaced. However, big negative- the park advertises 35% capacity. No way. Not even close. Every ride was over 1 hour wait. Most over 2 hours. Virtual queues were worse. I’ve been to Disney on days crowds were 9 or 10. This was more crowded. I felt less exposed in a ride queue than walking on the street. Universal DOES not have reserve spots right now. This means if you buy a ticket, and show up and the park is at capacity, you cannot get in. And if you do get in, and capacity is maxed, you will wait at least an hour for EACH ride. Note- this could be because of our travel dates, yes, BUT...  TIPS: If you choose to travel now, know that Universal does not reserve tickets. You might experience low crowds OR you might be denied. If you choose to go, stay on site if possible. You not only get priority entry, you get an hour before opening- this is crucial. Use it. We arrived at the gate by 630, and inside by 7. From there, we were able to experience DA without massive crowds, and more importantly, do other things and leave before the heaviest crowds. We did not experience massive crowding or lack of distancing, but again, we went early, followed the floor markers and did just a few things per day. And left before crowding occurred."""	
"10,""Be very careful when purchasing multiple day tickets for Universal. They are overselling during Covid. Thousands of people being turned away at 8:30 a.m. because the parks were """"at capacity"""". We had their buy 2 get 3 free tickets and could not get in. They need to have reservations like Disney. Paid $26 for parking and so far haven't recovered it. Very disappointed. Not the way to run a business."""	
"10,""Do not buy tickets. Social distancing and allowing less people in the park is a lie. Universal is selling more tickets than the park has capacity for. The amount of people in the park is ridiculous and aside from mask, the park is not doing anything to keep guest safe. I attempted to go 12/29. Every adult ride had a 2-9 hour wait, while those without a virtual line were at capacity the entire day.  The virtual line is a joke. I attempted to sign up for several rides using this method. However every time I attempted to sign up. I was told the time slot was no longer available. The virtual line only allow you to attempt to check in at 11am. 2 and 3pm. All rides were “at capacity” the entire day.  Universal is scheming people out of money. Knowing the person will be unable to get into the park or unable to ride any rides, due to the extreme wait times.  I have waited 2+ hour for a ride before, but I did not have to wait an extended amount of time for every single ride. I had a wonderful time my first two times in the park in 2018 & 2019, but after this. I do not think I will be returning"""	
"10,""Worst part of our vacation. We returned as part of our family Christmas vacation hoping to enjoy the Harry Potter exhibit. Everything was packed. No places to eat without a two hour wait. Prices are outrageous, staff inept, no one was controlling crowds so you didn’t know what you were in line for or even if you were in a line. Universal is not equipped to handle this kind of capacity, obviously. Compared to Disney World, which has this crowd control thing down to a science. Wish we would have used our Universal money for another day at DW. I doubt we will return. BTW, as of this writing, we’ve been in line at a SANDWICH SHOP for one and a half hours and still don’t have food. Stat away! You’ll thank me later."""	
"10,""The park reached capacity at 9am and they won't allow me to get a refund. On top of that our online tickets had a system error that caused us to wait in line for an additional 2 hours the day before. Needless to say I will not becoming back to universal......... EVER!!! I recommend everyone go to Disney because they have better customer service during the covid era."""	
"50,""Both parks are absolutely fabulous but Studios has a special place in my heart. The shows are amazing. If you can, go to the Horror Makeup Show. It is not scary at all and is truly hilarious."""	
"10,""Do not buy tickets to Universal, they are selling tickets to thousands of people who will never be able to get in the park! Do not waist your time or money! My boyfriend and I bought 2 day tickets a month ago. We flew down for our short vacation only to find out we could not get in the park due to capacity! So Universal Studios continues to sell tickets even though they know you can’t possibly get in the park! As I said, we purchased the tickets a month ago and chose the dates Dec 28 and 29 for the purchase. We waited in line for 2 hours at guest services to see what type of compensation we could receive. Guest services told us they were still selling tickets as of yesterday to people for Dec 28th. Our day we booked a month ago and couldn’t get in. And for all this they gave us nothing! Only a refund for the park tickets! What about our flights? What about our hotel? What about the time off work? I know they can’t reimburse for all of those but at least offer park tickets for our next trip to Florida? Nope. Absolutely nothing! I can’t express enough how disgusted I am with Universal."""	
"10,""We got here since 8.20am after long walk and lines to get in we found the theme parks are at capacity since 9am. This is the 2nd day happened to us. We bought 2days tickets but we couldn't use any and we have to leave and go home. Poor customer service! They only let people in their resorts in first. We want our money back!!"""	
"10,""Worst park experience ever - info on website did not match info in the park - guest services failed to explain how assistance pass worked - luckily a really nice ride operator explained it - can only ride rides with a fast pass but you can’t buy those or you have to spend almost as much as the ticket to get in. I check park notifications and COVID info to try to get a feel for how things would work - except neither one of those told you most of the rides only worked with virtual line which were never available - bought a dining pass but it didn’t work with mobile ordering so either had to stand in line for an hour or pay full price - there were park personnel standing everywhere with signs that said line starts here but nothing telling you what you were standing in line for - second day here the parks reached capacity before 9:30 am but they still keep letting people in - NO ONE WAS COMING FOR CITY WALK. - they were coming for the park but sure let’s let 100s of people in - this park has no idea how to work lines, their assistance pass system is horrifying, their surge pricing for fast passes is despicable - as they say - ONE STAR - DO NOT RECOMMEND."""	
"10,""??????It’s infested of people even with COVID, we came at 7:00am and its already everything at maxed capacity and you cannot enter any game, its a waste of your money and time, do not come, they should really give priority to tourists, they charge $250 for one park a day and residents can come any time."""	
"40,""Went for holidays and holiday parade etc. Not the same holiday feel as other parks this time of year.  Can probably do both parks somewhat easily with either fast pass or single rider. However, would recommend save money and use single rider rather than fast pass. Save the money. Single rider just as efficient.  I went around holidays and wait times and crowds were not bad at all. Didn't find anywhere appetizing for a meal at this park. Missed a water fountain show of some sort.  There are some fun rides , really cool but after awhile start to seem a little bit all the same after a while but great for first timers. First timers should love it!  Best Diagon Alley (not a ride) but don't miss ice cream shop there, though line is long. Escape from Gringots Hollywood Rip Rockit - Roller coaster choose own music Transformers Simpsons fun if never done Jimmy Fallon ride is a little different and fun Minions Shrek Fast and Furious is fun if never done before  Disappointing ET Men In Black Revenge of Mummy over too fast Annoying to always put bags/purses in lockers"""	
"10,""Went to Universal Studios and was disappointed. First the place was crowded, the line to get your temperature checked was extremely long. There was no safe distancing, no sanitizing stations and the mask issue was not enforced .  Walked out and demanded a refund. Stay away I& you care about your health."""	
"20,""Harry Potter pavilion is over crowded and nobody from the administration seems to take care about it. There is no way to keep the distance because nobody controls the amount of people who are coming into the Harry Potter part of the park. If you want to get infected go there"""	
"10,""I’ve been to Universal many, many times. This was my first Covid visit and as requested we all tried to maintain social distancing guidelines etc. Whilst ordering some ice cream at Harry Potter World I asked another guest to please maintain their distance and while ordering the employee rudely asked we order and “move, move”. When I asked to not yell and give me time to order she was abruptly rude and explosive. My response was simple: “this doesn’t happen at Disney”. The employee was not representative of an experience one pays good money for. You’d think the park would be extra appreciative of guests visiting during these Covid times but maybe it’s just wishful thinking on my part. Thumbs down for Universal Studios Orlando this time."""	
"20,""If you are a huge Harry Potter fan, those parts of the park you would highly appreciate. I would give it a 3/5 for that specifically.  However....be prepared to wait a minimum of an hour for every single ride. Went in at 9, was able to ride two rides before lunch time. Social distancing was highly enforced when waiting in line. When you exit the ride, the main common areas are out of control. You’re literally running into people because it’s so crowded. If you’re worried about COVID, you definitely don’t want to come here. Everyone has there mask on, and that’s about it.  We were willing to pay for a fast pass at its advertised base rate, but they increase the rate/day based on the demand. $190+ for a one day fast pass!?! No thanks! Virtual Lines on the app are a joke. Either it won’t let you pick a time at all or you pick a time, the app takes forever to load, and then it says the time you just clicked on isn’t available anymore. (My phone is a new, updated iPhone, so I know it’s in fine working condition)  Many of the rides are some variation of sitting in a seat and watching the action in 3D. At least Disney has more interactive, real rides"	
"50,""My family went to Universal Orlando Park for the Grandkids birthday we had a wonderful time. I was very please how they kept us safe. While waiting in line we saw the employee do very good cleaning"""	" not majority screen based with 3D glasses.  We’re going to try to go back at night to see if that helps ride times go down. If not, we’ll happily look at other things to do in Orlando and spend our money somewhere else."""
"10,""Right when you show up at opening you are greeted with at a minimum 50 minute lines for everything, so you ride 2 attractions by noon and then the rest of the lines are 2 or 3 hours at this point. Virtual lines??? Ha, no way of getting on those, even though we tried all day. And then other attractions are at full capacity. So we left and got lunch outside of universal, because if you eat there, its another hour wait. I know what you're thinking, we should have bought the express pass. We were going to but they jacked those prices up to $200 per person. We paid over $100 for a regular ticket, but we got to pay 3 tines that to get on the rides? Social distancing, forget about it. Shoulder to shoulder as you walk through the park. The only positive thing i can say is that the few attractions we were able to get on were fun, but not worth the time and money spent. They let in way to many people so that they can make their millions. Too bad, I was excited to go, but now we are trying to figure out what to do the rest of our trip."""	
"10,""Absolute waste of 700 dollers. Took 3 hours to get through one ride. Unless you can afford another 200 a piece for express plan on spending your entire time sitting on a sidewalk waiting to get on a ride. Staff does not care. Did one ride which took half the day and left. It is basically a glorified shopping mall that you really cant afford to shop in. Don't waste your time. Seven hundred for 4 people and did ONE RIDE."""	
"10,""If I could give zero stars, I would. We planned this trip as a Christmas gift for our 3 kids. By the time we got in the park, the lines were already 100+ minute wait time. We were told to sign up for the virtual lines but those were gone in seconds. We had a disability pass. When we used the disability pass, it was fine for Gringots but when we went back for our reserved time at Fast and Furious , we were told the ride was at capacity and we’d have to come back to try again. What’s the point of reserving a time, if they’re just going to turn us away. Then, we decided to forego the disability pass and just wait in the regular line, only to be told they were only taking Express pass and Virtual Line reservations. Basically, we paid $1100 for a glorified shopping mall. Not only that but the staff was extremely rude. We had to walk around for over an hour, to find somewhere to eat that wasn’t a two hour wait. By then we were nauseous and exhausted, only to be turned away at every ride we went too. At this point we had only been there for 4 hours and miserable. Our person with a disability took their mask off as they were exiting, only to be followed by a security person, who felt the need to pretend to do their job. We went to guest services to seek a refund, only to encounter more hassle because we purchased our tickets from a military facility. The manager, Ryan, told us we’d end up owing more money than we paid for the tickets. Or we’d have to wait 16 weeks for a 3rd party to refund us our money, just to find that to be incorrect after calling whatever number HE gave us. Ryan the manager also took our tickets, saying we’re surrendering them. Now we’re in Orlando, at Christmas, with no parks to go to. Not that we’d ever step foot in there, ever again! But boy oh boy, there was plenty of shopping to do. $80 for a Harry Potter backpack. $70 for a freaking sweatshirt. Thanks Universal for taking a massive dump on our Christmas. Finally, while they don’t seem to care much about social distancing they do have mask natzis all over. Don’t you dare take a drink while you’re waking. And by the way, feel free to smoke in their designated smoking in the CENTER OF THE PARK!"""	
"50,""Mardi Gras - I have never been to New Orléans Mardi Gras however this was so much fun and the food - oh it was so good, the parades were awesome and having park guest up on the floats throwing beads was fun. Great part atmosphere. I want to give a huge shout out to the cleaning cast members - as soon as the parade was over they were out there cleaning everything up so that wining minutes you had no idea a parade had just gone through."""	
"50,""Had a great time at Universal Studios Dec 14th - yes during a pandemic - arrived by 9am - temperature checked at City Walk entry"	
"30,""Its just as crowded as before covid. Hand sanitizer smells bad. Doesn't seem customer friendly. Not very clean safe or festive"""	" attractions opened at 10am. Fortunately they had an rest area where you can take off the mask while you wait. There was staff cleaning tables. Prior to attractions entry - staff administered hand sanitizer to EACH guest - young and old! Loved the extra pre-cautions!! There was also sanitizer upon exiting. NO single riders. Since I went alone, I had a ride to myself for Simpson and Minions rides. Fast & Furious - they seated every other row. . I saw - at least two attractions - where staff was getting ready to spray seats while we were exiting. Other attractions like Bourne Stuntacular, 3 seats were left vacant per family/group. Also, there were staff around the park with signs reminding everyone about masks. Again had a great time!"""
"50,""We visited in August 2017 staying at Sapphire Falls resort. Everything was wonderful. We were looking forward to going again this year, but due to COVID, it didn’t happen. So looking forward to returning when things are back to normal. The thing that impressed me most was the reasonable price of the hotel rooms. For the price we paid for 1 room at Disney world, we got 2 connecting rooms at Sapphire Falls. Unlike Disney, Universal does not try to suck every penny from your pocket. Hotel rooms, food, and park tickets are all more reasonable and the experience is just as good, if not better. Try Universal, stay in one of their hotels. You will be impressed."""	
"50,""So much for the family! Harry Potter World is a lot of fun. My son loved the NY ride and my daughter the Simpson's ride. Lots to do!"""	
"30,""I was part of the Orlando meetup group. Event was from 2-12 Friday and 3-130 am Saturday.  I’m not a large guest, but i am a 6 foot 1woman athletic build. My sister in law came and she is think on her bottom half of her body with a gut. So i researched what rides would accommodate and if you are a bigger person, rides such as spider man, transformers, jimmy kimmel, Simpsons, men in black should work out. Maybe even forbidden forest. I’ve seen bigger people manage to get on the hagrids ride as well. It all depends on body type. But the before rides for sure will work. Rides like the mummy and gringotts bank,not so much.  So i took my sister in law on forbidden Journey. The guy NEIL, tall African American guy was able to get her in the ride and had her relax her arms. The second time we got on they attempted to push it down once made us get off and didn’t even tell us what was happening. So i told them we’ve rode before, they offered a test seat. I said we did test seat and rode BEFORE. They attempted it again and then made us get off again.  So i went all the way down and found Neil and told him could He help us get on because we just rode, he got my sis in law again back on the ride.  They need to teach everyone how to help larger guests get on the rides. I understand there are restrictions and body types matter but to barely help, seen so many ppl get booted off. It was sad.  And what’s crazy is for the hagrids ride? Even hagrid wouldn’t fit. I really hope down the road they consider supporting more body types, there are so many bigger people walking universal than anyone else.  On Saturday"	
"50,""It’s a lot of walking but you don’t notice it, till the end of the night. We ate dinner in the park and found everything we needed. The rides are great and if you take lift, it’s pretty easy and fast to get into the park. I’d highly recommend going in December. The Christmas decorations make it more special. It’s also less packed. I do advise an express pass if you can afford it. It’s well worth it. We stood in line to get on the train for an hour and most rides had an hour wait time. If you want to hit every ride in one day, you will need an express pass. If you can’t afford it, I suggest getting to the park before the gates open and be the first in the gate to save time. Then take a big break for a few hours during power times and eat lunch or just rest a bit, then get back in lines after 6, to hit more rides. It’s a must experience. If your a Harry Potter fan this is an AWSOME time."""	" i waited 1 hour to ride gringotts bank and the ride broke and so we were stuck on the track and eventually forced to finish the ride the opposite way of the screen which messed up the experience.  I had no issues getting on ride but was asked to do test seat for hagrids which is possible it’s standard as they did ask if it was my first time. there was a moment i thought i wouldn’t be able to ride but i was able to click in.  If i didn’t have the meet up which allowed me to ride rides after the park closed, i would of never been able to experience hagrids.the lines are socialcdistances as much as they could have been and there are a ton of single riders due to COVID so you’re waiting longer than pre COVID times I’m sure. The virtual line didn’t work most of the time i was there. The line was so long some ppl waited hours for just a 3 minute experience. The experience is amazing but such a long line it goes so deep you have never seen how far the line can go until you’ve done this ride.  The park was at capacity most of the trip so if i didn’t have the meet up, i wouldn’t of been able to do much if anything at all. Unless you stay on a resort and can experience park early you’ll be on waitlist for basically everything and walking around with barely any place to sit. It was WAY too many people there for the park to say it was safe. Harry Potter world a disaster. The biggest attraction there obviously and no social distancing could possibly be done unless you were in gringotts bank waiting to ride the ride.  So if you’re going during COVID understand if you don’t go early and plan to spend all day there you will not be able to do much.  The last time i was here pre COVID and pre hagrids ride, i was able to do at least 10-13 rides in a day and eat twice and get butter beer 4 times. and i spent most of my day at Harry Potter world and rode express back and forth.  I tried to replicate that trip and it was impossible. I was there from 2-12 am. Because again the meet up started once park closed. I was only able to do 6 rides. Even with park closed it was just so many people and there is just So much walking.  Just prepare for a minimum 3 day trip so you can at least experience every ride you want ONCE.  So i rated this 3 out of 5 due to them not accommodating body types like they need to. (Disney is better at this). For literally allowing the park to be at capacity, you can’t do shut when this occurs FYI. I was even told if i left the park(which you have to, to get to other park if you have both tickets, if you choose not to do hogwarts express which was a 2 hour wait) i wouldn’t be able to re enter which wasn’t true at all.  Train your staff better on policies and getting people to snap into their seats safely , accommodate your larger guests and stop discriminating."""
"40,""Husband and I went in November and it was mostly great. You MUST have a smartphone as almost everything is done online, ie. food ordering, restaurant reservations, checking ride wait times, etc. so make sure phones are charged and someone is good at navigating this way. Maps are not available at all. I can see where it would be frustrating without a Fastpass, but fortunately we went on days that weren't busy. In order to see all of Harry Potter world, you must go to BOTH parks but you can't ride the train unless you have a Parkhopper pass, which we didn't so that was annoying. We can't ride all the crazy coasters anymore so it was extremely frustrating, downright DISCRIMINATING that we were refused on the Pterodactyl ride because we didn't have a child with us! If it's a weight issue than post a weight limit! I know parents of kids that weigh more than we do combined. Would've sat in different seats even. Complete B.S. that only some adults get to ride! Louie's had good Italian fast food and reasonably priced. Harry Potter Forbidden Journey was the coolest ride I've ever experienced! Loved King Kong too. Purchased a dinner/movie combo online before we went and of course it's a limited menu. Antojitos was decent, loved the live entertainment! So the next night we go to use our coupon & the sandwich shop had never heard of this deal but were very nice and accepted our tickets. Then we watched Guardians of the Galaxy on the big screen. A very nice way to unwind before heading back to our hotel. Overall we had a good time but have no plans on going back. Bucket list destination, check."""	
"50,""COVID-19 precautions were great! Had a fun time! Definitely worth my money! The Harry Potter section was fun and interactive!"""	
"40,""My husband and I are slowly but surely checking off Orlando theme parks to visit each time we are in Orlando. This year, we visited Universal Studios. My husband and I are in our twenties, and we went to the park with our friends. We enjoyed the park for about 4 hours then we were ready to go. I think with smaller children there are more attractions to visit plus during the pandemic many attractions were limited, or not even open. We entered the park right at opening and went straight for Gringotts which I highly recommend. There was hardly a line and this ride is awesome. I wasn't a Harry Potter fan until after this ride and wandering around Diagon Alley. The Transformers attraction was also a good time. We didn't make it on the Minion ride because of the line, but if I visit again, that would be a must. I am very impressed with the cleanliness of the park, especially during the pandemic. The bathrooms were remarkably clean for the number of people frequenting the park daily."""	
"50,""Go here if you’re in Orlando! We had to take some crazy timeshare tour by Westgate to get a discount on our tickets but after saying no 100x to the person trying to get us to get the timeshare we were on our way. Universal itself is amazing! So beautiful and definitely do Citywalk! The drinks, the food, the atmosphere is awesome!! Voodoo doughnuts was so good! Unfortunately hardly any of the Harry Potter rides were open on the Universal Orlando side but the one that was open was sooo good! I’m terrified of coasters but I would do it again! Had an awesome time here."""	
"40,""Let me begin by saying they should keep the safety measurements in place post Covid-19.  Hand sanitizer everywhere.  Staff holding sign to remind you to wear your mask and to wear it properly.  Blue ground markings to remind you to social distance.  Temperature taken prior to park entry.  Small wait times.  The most crowded area was Harry Potter area."""	
"50,""They are doing a great job with make visitors/guests fell safe! I can't wait to bring the kids back! 11/29/20 - 12/02/20 very low attendance."""	
"30,""I was extremely impressed when I first got to Universal! We were staying on the property and I liked how our temperature was taken daily before we could get on the bus to the parks. The bus limited capacity and mandated masks which made us feel quite comfortable. When you got to the park hand sanitizer stations were abundant as well as signage stating social distancing and mask rules. Lines were kept spread apart and aside from a few people who couldn’t follow those directions (which I quickly told to back up) most people abided by them.  Then came Harry Potter world. What a DISASTER. It was crowded, there was no social distancing unless it was in a line, and the only sign that there was a pandemic was that people were wearing face masks. Luckily we got early admission into the park by staying on property so we were able to bop on a couple HP rides before the gobs of people swarmed in. After 10am hit we left that part of the park simply for fear of being around so many people. No one was enforcing distancing which, I get, can be a near impossible task, but something more needed to be done. Maybe if the capacity into HP world itself was limited and virtual lines were always in effect it would have some crowd control. I really wanted to enjoy diagon alley, but since that park didn’t have early admission during the week we were barely able to. There were just too many people to feel safe there. It was so unfortunate.  We wound up cutting our trip short by 2 days because the weekend was coming and it was getting crowded. We left today (supposed to leave Monday) - went to the park for the early admission, changed our flight, and flew home. Today the lines were insane just to get into the park. There was a noted difference between early and general admission, albeit smaller today (Friday) than Wednesday and Thursday. As soon as the park opened for general admission it was like a wall of people went dashing for HP world. Seriously though, there was a roped off section by Dr Seuss landing and there was a giant crowd of people not following social distancing protocols AT ALL. Once 10am hit they swarmed in, some running, to get in line. It was crazy. I was so disappointed by that. I get it, Harry Potter is a money maker for the park, but allowing that many people to congregate in one small space is just ridiculous. Luckily we went during the week for the first part of our trip or I would not have lasted one day.  All in all we felt safe when we were in lines and walking around the park as long as it was during the hour of early admission or not in Harry Potter world. I sanitized on my own at the lockers before and after the rides and when sanitizer was given to me prior to boarding. It was, on average, 4 sanitizes per ride experience (3 of which were my own doing at park provided stations). So. Much. Sanitizer. When possible I would find a bathroom that was off the beaten path to go wash my hands the old fashion way. In bathrooms located in high traffic areas it was, for lack of a better saying, a sh*t show. There were people at every sink and hand dryer shoulder to shoulder. It was crazy. If you go, find a more secluded spot to relieve yourself and wash your hands.  Most of the staff did a good job making sure people were wearing masks properly, however, there were still several people wearing them under their nose.  Before we went I watched a ton of videos of people in the park but I guess I didn’t research enough inside Harry Potter world because that probably would have changed my mind."""	
"10,""Purchased a meal deal at citywalk and went to margaritaville. Worst decision I've ever made in my life. Waiter snatched my ticket from my table and never gave me my diet coke I asked 3 times for. Flagged down another waiter.  Very unpleased, waiter left a bad taste in my mouth."""	
"50,""Universal did an amazing job during this pandemic. The park was very clean. Everyone wore masks. We stayed on property which made it very convenient for kids to get to the parks."""	
"50,""Absolutely adore this place! Universal Parks are definitely my theme park of choice in Orlando area. Harry Potter world is just incredible, especially Diagonal Alley that’s in this specific park. It’s jaw-dropping, literally feels like you’ve been teleported into the movie. The Escape to Gringotts ride is a great ride too. The Mummy and Rip Ride Rockit are my other favorites, just great classic roller coasters with a little added touch. Men in Black is fun to get a change of pace and go shoot down some aliens. There are a bunch of fun virtual rides like the Minion ride, Transformers, Fast and Furious, Simpsons, Shrek and more. The ET ride, hidden at the way back is super cute too and a great one for the kiddos. They also have constant shows being performed and different movie characters walking around taking pictures and interacting with people. Covid-wise I feel that they have done a great job being organized and taking needed measures. If you aren’t wearing your mask properly they are sure to politely correct you. Social distancing in lines and on rides they make sure to separate each party. They also have “U Rest” areas where you can go sit and take your mask off and get a break from it, I think that’s super considerate and I definitely used those areas a few times in my visits. I just love Universal, even though everything is overpriced (like all theme parks) the experience is always worth it and such a great time."""	
"20,""Family of 5 (two adults, 8, 6 & 6) about $750 spent for one day ($657 +/- on tickets alone)  We were hoping to get the Veteran’s/Military discount but that doesn’t apply on Tuesdays.  Wow. What a disappointment.  Dede was working ET and was rude to my husband and 8-year-old son when the ride broke down today (Dec. 1). We were next in line to ride and got held up a while.  We couldn’t find a paper maps anywhere so we were looking down at our phones the whole time trying to get everything situated. Ordering food at one of the restaurants was very frustrating because it was done through the app.  We accidentally went past the time limit on the free lockers and had to pay about $30 extra for all of us. That just soured the experience—because everything was soooooooo expensive—we felt very nickeled and dimed for everything. And for what we paid, it was disappointing.  And for the kids and gift shops—most everything was $10+. There was a pair of plastic Minion glasses for $16 ?? and you can get a package of boys underwear (5 pairs) for $26!!! The same stuff they sell at Walmart!!!!  I know the prices are going to be marked up but it is just an exorbitant amount.  Please lower your prices so more families’ pockets won’t be pinched so bad and more kids can enjoy the parks!"""	
"10,""Due to the new """"virtual line"""" you will be discriminated against if you do not have a smartphone. Basically the people who are the richest with the fastest phone are the only ones that will be able to ride the new Hagrid ride. We talked to a family in line who all had the new Iphones and they were able to go on the ride multiple times because they reserved spots for their whole family on their different phones. Meanwhile I've gone to the park, paid for parking every time, and haven't been able to go on (I do have a smartphone, it's just not a very expensive fast one). If you call to give a review they say the best they can do is tell you is to go during the week (impossible for working families, I'm a teacher), get there early (I've done this every weekend I've gone), and keep refreshing the app (really takes away from the fun of universal to have to be staring at your phone constantly refreshing, just for you to never be able to get on the ride). I've been to Universal/IOA 5 times since this ride open and still have never been able to ride this ride because of the """"Virtual line"""". I've had to pay $26 every time for parking, but if you tell Universal that their only option is """"pay us more money for a more expensive pass that includes parking, then you can come up here more often, but you still may not get on the ride"""" I don't mind waiting 2+ hours to ride a ride I really want to ride. It's absolutely heartbreaking to not be able to get on the ride because your poor and don't have a good enough phone so they won't let you even get in line.  I called guest services to try to understand better how the line works and the lady I spoke to Mikayla was so rude, in the middle of me talking about my experience she cut me off and said """"Well if you let me finish I can tell you my tips (what I listed above)"""" Basically she didn't want to hear any feedback about the park, only read a script she is told to read to the customers. I asked to speak to someone else and she said she is capable of getting my message to others. I don't know how she plans to do that since she wouldn't even listen to my experience. I always loved Universal, but there current virtual line system, rude employees (some are very nice, but some are extremely rude), and lack of customer service (they used to be much better)."""	
"10,""Poorly advertised their adjusted conditions for what to expect when coming into the park. This was ran like a struggling company trying to make a dollar instead of a multi billion dollar company. Worse experience I have had at a park. Disney would never. I will never go back to Universal. I will be back at Disney because it runs and functions like a well oiled multi billion dollar company that cares about your experience."""	
"20,""They're trying but not enough. So many times it's impossible to social distance and way too many people take their masks off. Don't be surprised if you go and come back with covid. It sucks really the staff are nice and deserve the work but not enough is being done to keep you safe."""	
"50,""Our family of five spent the last 4 days at Universal Studios. It was our first time visiting Universal/Disney and it was such a great experience. Lots of great staff members and Universal but Lauren E on on the Hague’s ride went above and beyond!! She did all that she could to ensure that our family had a great experience. We rode this ride once daily for the last 4 days and Universal should be proud to have a wonderful employee like Lauren!"""	
"10,""Park is fine I would never stay at the Wyndham hotel ever. Terrible customer service and accommodations."""	
"10,""I really didn't enjoy this theme park. What a waste of money. But this is jut my opinion. The wait time for rides were extremely long and this was during the slow time."""	
"10,""Today my family and I spent the day there and was there for only 1 hour. Every ride was 60 to 120 wait time, the park was at its capacity. There were some employees and supervisors being rude to people, not greeting no one, no smile on their face. I felt this is a unhappy environment and unfair. It’s ridiculous the park keep allowing more people in and the park is full. There were a lot of undercover agents in secrets walking around with a evil look, one was watching me and I feel uncomfortable being there. My family and I deserve to be at another theme park that fits us better, too many secretive people undercover will watch you making it uncomfortable. 2020 is already difficult and now this park was the worst I’ve experienced. The Macy parade was cancelled, it was only two haunted houses and then a unexpected haunted house happened on Halloween. The boat anchor in front of the SpongeBob store look like two penis and the alien voice on the E.T sounds like it’s saying “Welcome home, you will d**”. I hope when I come back to this place, things will change, but for now, my family and I are going somewhere better."""	
"40,""Food and food service in park is pretty bad so get your food at one of the several restaurants on City Walk. Hard Rock is a standout. Park is clean with some very good rides. Friendly staff. The Harry Potter Hagrid motorcycle ride is the best coaster I have ever been on, hands down. Lots of 4D rides with Transformers, Spider-Man , and Harry Potter as the Standouts. The Simpsons 4D was good as well. The Rocking roller coaster was also a great ride. Shrek Theater ‘4D’ is dated and lame. King Kong 4D was decent. Fast and Furious is only worth it if there is no line."""	
"50,""My favorite ride here is Escape from Gringotts and the Mummy. For the family Men is black is really run."""	
"30,""I am going to give an honest review of both parks and our hotel. I know I will get some crappy canned response from Universal's Customer service as they really don't seem to care or want to really listen to what people are saying so just know that yeah yeah safety blah blah, comfortable guest experience blah sorry you blah blah, yeah i've heard and read it before so just don't with the canned response. Ok, here goes the review.  We decided to go and stay for 5 days, totally don't ever spend 5 days here, not worth it, We went to both parks, forwent the water park as i didn't want to get COVID from people not wearing masks (which is improbable at a water park) so first park I'm going to review is this one, Universal.  1st day we arrived we stopped first for lunch as we were hungry, we went to the Today Cafe, the food was awful, my husband has a disorder where he shakes, I asked the young woman to please not fill his drink all the way up as they don't have lids, what does she do, she OVERFILLS the cup so i had to hold his cup for him until he could get enough drink down where it wouldn't spill if he held the cup.  Here are the kudos, we did notice constant cleaning, all staff wearing gloves and masks signs everywhere and every guest wearing a mask or being told to wear one then handed one if they didn't have a proper mask (don't wear anything with a vent people, you will be told to remove it and given a paper mask to wear until you spend 10 bucks on one of theirs)  We rode a few rides as it was late in the day, one of them being the Mummy. I'm not young, i'm not skinny (i'm not so fat I need a scooter and i am not in the over size 18 jeans/pants) but I'm 49 and I have curves, boobs, hips etc, anyway to make a long story longer, we get on this ride, yes we fit, but we were thrown in the back of the car, then we were thrown around on the ride, seriously felt like my chunky butt was going to fly out of the car a few times, we never rode that again the rest of the time we were there, it was that bad.  We enjoyed pretty much all the rides, there were no real shows, it was very hot not super crowded so that was nice but here comes the rub: Harry Potters Escape from Gringotts, I have ridden this ride many times, we get up to the ride, i get in, the guy asks me to pull down on my bar, so i do, he tells me to keep pulling on it, ok so i push down, click click click, he says keep pushing at his point i'm in this thing so tight if i round a corner i puke up my organs, so i tell him i got it as far as i can push it, he then LOUDLY says well you don't fit, you're too big so unfortunately you can't ride but he can (meaning my husband who is bigger than i am) anyway i got little teens giving me the pitty look as i exit the vehicle and i shrug it off like ok fine i'm fat i'll go shop, well as i'm leaving I hear the same kid laughing so i turn and look at him and he's shooting me a look, well i think ok well he's a kid he has no manners life sucks i'm over it. Next day we go to the other Harry Potter at Islands of Adventure, I fit on the rides (well Hagrids wasn't working that day, but it worked a few days later and yup rode that neck breaking back hurting thrown you around holy crap i need a chiropractor now ride) shocker shocker, so i go back the next day to the Gringotts sit in the outside seat and i fit, not a problem, by this time i'm livid so we repeated the line and same kid working, i get in again with the """"you dont' fit"""" so i asked for another attendant to come over, and click click click, i fit. So here is the rub with this, the kid might be new, he might not have been pushing it correctly but I feel that Universal's rides discriminate against those who are larger, I noticed alot of larger men and women and children and it's not cheap to go and they would be turned away from rides because they are larger. It's not fair to them, Disney's rides accommodate those who are larger, i get it there needs to be a limit to size but for the girl who is a size 18/22 who has hips and can't ride, or the guy who is 6'2 250 pounds and can't ride, the body builders, I mean c'mon you gotta look at everyone and not just those who are a size 2. Universal needs to understand that people are bigger than they used to be. Ok rant about size and discrimation over.  I'm going to move on to food now, we ate at Krusty Burger, i took ONE bite of my burger and nearly threw up, it was AWFUL, like horrible awful the most disguisting thing i've ever eaten. The manager was kind and got me something else, burned chicken strip that were dry and just as bad. Don't eat here, seriously it's that bad. We also ate dinner at Lombard's, food was ok, salty but ok, but the waitress....i think she was half awake. We were there for 2 hours, TWO. It took her forever to take our order, forever to bring our drinks, and well you get the point. We ate at City Walk most of the time, food seemed to be a bit better.  Anyway both parks i would say do 2 day park to parks, you can cover the entire place in that space of time. If you want the water park, wait until this COVID stuff is over so you can actually enjoy it. Over all it was ok, we won't be going back any time soon as i feel it wasn't a good value.  Here's my note for Universal Management and HR: Universal, train your staff better, and please for the love of god, look at your reviews, seriously you have LOTS and i do mean LOTS of complaints about your rides, seat sizes and how your employees can be insensitive to those who are larger/taller. You need to really work on this, and no i don't want your canned response about safety ok, read that too many times on these reviews."""	
"50,""(Due to Pandemic) I wanted to know toll cost & locations. Unable to get B/4 leaving, I'm sharing, hoping to help someone else. GA to FL (SB) entering @ Wildwood FL off 75 . Only 1 manned toll gate @ Leesburg, $3.25, they offer change, only other toll is at exit 75A -unmanned with sign saying DO NOT STOP your tag will be charged. Cost is 80 Cents."""	
"50,""My review is based on our time of visit, we were there the week after Halloween and before the Christmas events start and during COVID. As such, the parks were not terribly crowded. Everyone was temp checked on the way in or at the resort, masks were mandatory, social distancing was (generally) observed. Everyone got hand sanitizer on every ride and I saw staff sanitizing seats too. They seemed to be doing everything they could to keep visitors safe. That being said, I loved our trip, we rode everything, although a few rides were not running. Defiantly get the app to keep tabs on line times. We managed to ride everything in two days."""	
"50,""Going to Disney in Orlando is a confusing and problematic affair. Above that the parks have been neglected for decades. But there is a new king in town and it is Universal Studios Florida. Both Universal Studios, the movie park and Islands of Adventure are worth a visit. Customer service does remind you to the old days when WDW was amazing. The team members are a delight and a spontaneous exploration of the stunning attractions and food offerings is just wonderful. Both parks offer Harry Potter themed lands and yes they are the new standard in theme park experiences with stunning decor and world class attraction and shows but the resort has so much more to offer and you would do yourself a disservice not to visit the many wonderful attractions these resorts have to offer. My favorites In Universal Studios: Harry Potter Escape from Gringotts, The Hogwarts Express (you need a 2 day or hopper pass for this one, take the 2 day pass and thank me later) The Jason Bourn stuntspectular, The Mummy, Man in Black, Transformers and E.T.. And please don't miss the Horror and Make-up show and The Blues Brothers. My favorites In Islands of Adventure: The Hulk, Spiderman, Popeye, Kong, Jurassic Park River Adventure, Hogwarts, Hagrids Motorbike Adventure and the high in the sky Seuss trolley train ride (especially at night when the Christmas decorations are up)."""	
"10,""Starting this review as I’m at the park (Saturday 11/14/2020)... I’ve only been here for 30 minutes, and it’s been such a turn off... (getting through the temperature screening, security check, entrance line) SO CROWDED!!! The crowds are similar to before covid, almost like there’s no maximum limit with the capacity. Lines to get into the park were so crowded, so it’s hard for people to physical distance. There shouldn’t be an exception for the day of the week- just because it’s Saturday isn’t an excuse for it to be more crowded than normal. I definitely don’t feel safe here. (I was at DisneyWorld the past 4 days and the crowd/physical distancing handling is way better there. You must reserve your days before going to the parks, which I think is a much better idea.)  Physical distancing in the restaurants good. Stores: Absolutely impossible to physical distance inside stores, there’s no regulation of the capacity, there aren’t any clear indications of entrances and exits.  People are eating and drinking things in line with their masks off. Some aren’t following the physical distancing markers on the floor.  I want to give a shout out to the workers, they’re really trying their best to keep people safe and deal with people who don’t physical distance/wear their masks properly. The workers look drained from the crowd that’s been going on today. Some workers aren’t wearing proper masks, some have openings around their chin area. Universal should provide their workers with a standard mask or managers should make sure their workers are wearing the proper mask. If I worked here, I wouldn’t feel safe due to the crowds.  Overall, I honestly wish I didn’t come!"""	
"10,""Waste of time! You pay for s full ticket and cant hardly ride in anything. There are time limits, amount of people per ride per day, so, after getting here at 9 am, paying $138, we are yet to ride, every where we have made an attempt to go it has been unavailable and is already 12:35.. keep in mind they close at 5pm “WTH” They should say this before you spend your money! Waste of a day... Waste of Money..."""	
"50,""I must admit I’m and have always liked Universal Studios in Orlando. I’ve had tons of fun at this place, however I was doubtful about visiting during COVID. I was a bit worried the whole situation could drain all the fun out of the park experience, and worst of all it could turn out to be unsafe (from a health standpoint). Boy was I wrong! The park has done a remarkable job at keeping the whole experience as close as possible to the “normal” (pre-COVID) experience. All the rides were open and functioning, aside from one or two dining options, the rest of the dining venues were open, kiosks along the park were open, shows were ALL up and running. With that being said, one could expect longer waiting lines (due to social distancing) however they weren’t long at all. The most I had to wait for a ride was 30min.  Best of all (and I probably should have put this first) the park has done a stellar job at keeping everyone safe. Social distancing is the rule. People are kept at safe distances with lines on the floor to enforce social distancing, mask wearing is mandatory and aside from maybe a couple of idiots here and there who could care less about others, and were lowering their masks for no reason, everybody else was in perfect compliance. Hand sanitizer is dispensed by park attendants prior to getting on every ride which is absolutely outstanding.  If you need a “break from reality” while ensuring you are safe, I wouldn’t doubt going to Universal. If park staff read this, please keep it up!"""	
"30,""WARNING - if you change your reservation at a hotel, they do NOT change your park tickets if you bought a package. The hotel (in our case Royal Pacific) is separate from the park and do not communicate. We are seniors and had to stand in line for 90 minutes. They gave us a $10 gift card."""	
"50,""Our favorite Orlando destination! We are Annual Passholders, which is an amazing deal that provides unlimited park entry and discounts at the wonderful hotels and resorts on property. The parks are incredible with rides and streets that transport you to another place. The entire family will never forget the memories you make here!"""	
"50,""Have been enjoying both Universal parks since they first opened. Bought the 1 day/2 park ticket with unlimited visits thru Dec. 24 & no blackout dates. I am over 65 & am happy to say due to the sanitary, distancing & mask procedures in place, coupled with common sense, I am A-OK 2 weeks past my most recent visit. I chose the Universal deal over WDW because of the 2 haunted houses which were open thru Halloween. The houses were great as was the newest coaster Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure. Both parks have awesome attractions & IOA is my favorite, offering more thrill rides. Lines moved faster than expected due to social dist. Plenty of food options available. Staff was courteous & conscientious re: guest safety. Hope to go back several more times before the expiration date."""	
"50,""I was a little nervous going back to Universal as they have begun to re-open their parks again, but I greatly appreciated all of the precautions they have taken on their behalf to allow everyone to feel safe. Before we are allowed to reach the main area that checks our bags, everyone's temperature is taken and if it reaches a certain temperature, they will not allow the members to enter the park. What was great was the way that at each ride, there are painted markings on the ground that express where each person must stand to be 6 feet apart. I thought this system worked wonderfully without anything needed to be said. Everyone followed these guidelines the 4 days I was on vacation. What is also great is the way that the staff always has hand sanitizer on them and squirts a fair amount in everyone's hands right before entering the ride. Masks are required as well and everyone was doing their part. Wonderful experience overall and I felt super safe the whole trip with everyone doing their part to take the precautions that include the guests and staff!"""	
"40,""Really liked the cleanliness and organization. The park employees were friendly and helpful. The best aspect was the app that gives estimates on wait times for each ride. The Harry Potter exhibits were really good but you need a pass to both Universal and Adventure island to see the whole thing. Overall the food options in the park are a bit limited but you can go the restaurant area just outside the park for more options."""	
"40,""In COVID times it’s a struggle to find something for the entire family to enjoy. Universal seems to have gone to ‘full court press’ on Disney because our experience was great. Clean, refillable soda, great rides short wait times and great prices on discounted tickets.  We enjoyed our experience, even with the masks."""	
"50,""My husband and I love this park!! My absolute favorite part of this park is the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I am a huge Potter fan and it was an amazing experience to see and feel like I was in the movies. I highly suggest getting park-to-park passes to get the full Potter experience."""	
"50,""We came during this time because we knew ALOT of people were not traveling, for whatever reason. I loved that we didn't have to deal with the large crowds and crazy hot temps in Summer. We never waited longer than 20 minutes for a ride, and the weather was perfect!!"""	
"30,""Being passholder hold no benefit to staying in on site hotel as early access is offered to both but full park doesnt open which was dissapointing, we bypassed 30 min line when park opened for minions so kids could go to Barney land and ride woodpecker coaster only to be turned away after the walk saying it wouldnt open until an hour after the rest of the park. When we got back to Minions line was over 90 mins! With children and no virtual line option, this was not feasible so explored other parts of the park. Having reservations in Mythos at 1pm and line for train connecting both parks being over 2 hour wait, we had to go back to entrance and into front of other park to make our seating, would be more conveniant if there was another option for park to park access for passholders"""	
"40,""Harry Potter world was a little too busy for us to enjoy all of the rides, but we did love the chocolate frogs and butterbeer!"""	
"50,""The Harry Potter Theme is the best! We drived with the Hogwarts Express from one park to the other park and back (both drives are different) it was so much fun!"""	
"50,""Love the social distancing guidelines. Hand sanitizer everywhere including prior to getting on the ride (you don’t have a choice, it’s required) and as soon as you get off the ride. Most people following the social distance guidelines by standing at the floor markers provided. We’ve felt very safe during this visit! Minus the masks, we’re diggin this!! Although the masks aren’t that bad, just sweaty!"""	
"40,""I liked a lot the attractions. They are exciting and the park is awesome but walking all day long using face cover was very exhaustive."""
